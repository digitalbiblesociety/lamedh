<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A set of multipurpose css and xslt stylesheets for styling Bible output from usfm/usx. It makes a general assumption that each element generated from the source bible files will be given a class that matches the style attribute.

Our goal is to fully support style outputs for Bibles distributed as:
* html
* ePub
* Physical Books

The name of the project comes from the letter **לָמֶד** (lamedh). It's named after its shape as it looks a little like a shepherd’s staff. The shepherd used it to direct his animals, as if he was מְלַמֵד (melamed) teaching the animals the correct way to go.

And styling css is often like herding cats.

		<p class="imt1">INTRODUCTION & OUTLINE</p>
		<p class="ip">
			<span class="bk">The Book of Judith</span> is a deuterocanonical book, included in the Septuagint and the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian Old Testament of the Bible.
		</p>
		<p class="ipi">However, it is excluded from the Hebrew canon and assigned by Protestants to the apocrypha. The surviving Greek manuscripts contain several historical anachronisms, which is why some protestant scholars now consider the book non-historical: a parable, a theological novel, or perhaps the first historical novel.</p>
		<p class="ip">It tells of a Jewish widow, Judith, who uses her beauty and charm to destroy an Assyrian general and save Israel from oppression. The name Judith (Hebrew: יְהוּדִית‎, Modern: Yehudit, Tiberian: Yəhûḏîṯ, "Praised" or "Jewess") is the feminine form of Judah.</p>

		<p class="imt1">HISTORICITY</p>
		<p class="im">It is generally accepted that the Book of Judith is ahistorical. The fictional nature "is evident from its blending of history and fiction, beginning in the very first verse, and is too prevalent thereafter to be considered as the result of mere historical mistakes."</p>
		<p class="imi">Thus, the great villain is "Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled over the Assyrians" (1:1), yet the historical Nebuchadnezzar II was the king of Babylonia. Other details, such as fictional place names, the immense size of armies and fortifications, and the dating of events, cannot be reconciled with the historical record. Judith's village, Bethulia (literally "virginity") is unknown and otherwise unattested to in any ancient writing.</p>
		<p class="ip">Nevertheless, there have been various attempts by both scholars and clergy to understand the characters and events in the Book as allegorical representations of actual personages and historical events. Much of this work has focused on linking Nebuchadnezzar with various conquerors of Judea from different time periods and, more recently, linking Judith herself with historical female leaders, including Queen Salome Alexandra, Judea's only female monarch (76–67 BC) and its last ruler to die while Judea remained an independent kingdom.</p>
		<p class="ipq">
			When those days were over, all of them returned to their inheritance. Judith went back to Bethulia and remained on her estate. For the rest of her life she was renowned throughout the land. 
			Many wished to marry her, but she gave herself to no man all the days of her life from the time her husband, Manasseh, died and was gathered to his people.
			Her fame continued to increase, and she lived in the house of her husband, reaching the advanced age of one hundred and five.* n She set her maid free. And when she died in Bethulia, they buried her in the cave of her husband, Manasseh;o
		</p>
		<p class="ipr">(16:21-23)</p>
		<p class="ip">Although early Christians, such as Clement of Rome, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, read and used the Book of Judith,[citation needed] some of the oldest Christian canons, including the Bryennios List (1st/2nd century), that of Melito of Sardis (2nd century) and Origen (3rd century), do not include it. Jerome, when he produced his Latin translation, counted it among the apocrypha, (although he changed his mind and later quoted it as scripture, and said he merely expressed the views of the Jews), as did Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem and Epiphanius of Salamis.</p>
		<p class="ip">However, some influential fathers of the Church, including Augustine, Ambrose, and Hilary of Poitiers, considered Judith sacred scripture, and Pope Innocent I declared it part of the canon. In Jerome's Prologue to Judith he claims that the Book of Judith was "found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures". However, no such declaration has been found in the Canons of Nicaea, and it is uncertain whether Jerome is referring to the use made of the book in the discussions of the council, or whether he was misled by some spurious canons attributed to that council.</p>
		<p class="iq">“You are the glory of Jerusalem!</p>
		<p class="iq1">You are the great pride of Israel!</p>
		<p class="iq1">You are the great boast of our nation!</p>
		<p class="iq1">By your own hand you have done all this.</p>
		<p class="iq2">You have done good things for Israel,</p>
		<p class="iq3">and God is pleased with them.</p>
		<p class="iq2">May the Almighty Lord bless you forever!”</p>
		<p class="iq1">And all the people said, “Amen!”</p>
		<p class="ipr">(15:9-10)</p>
